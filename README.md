# AdamStoneProgrammingPortfolio
This is Adam Stone's computer programming portfolio of my favorite projects that I have created.

# 1] Reporting Consolidator

A laundromat chain wanted to automate data collection and dispersal about sales and other statistics in their stores. Several emails would come through with different statistics, and an employees would sift through the data, transfer select pieces of information into ZohoSheets, and send a summary email to the owners. This program also generates graphs that help analyze customer trends. Using Python 3, I created a program that automates all of these processes, and it is still running to help this business. (I have also changed all sensititve information into either environment variables or "XXXXXX" in the code for security purposes).

# 2] ChessAI

I am not exceptional at chess, so I decided to create an AI that plays chess using C# and the Unity game engine. This program uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and varying fitness functions to play chess at a superhuman level.
