# 1] Reporting Consolidator

A laundromat chain wanted to automate data collection and dispersal about sales and other statistics in their stores. Several emails would come through with different statistics, and an employees would sift through the data, transfer select pieces of information into ZohoSheets, and send a summary email to the owners. Using Python 3, I created a program that automates all of these processes, and it is still running to help this business.
